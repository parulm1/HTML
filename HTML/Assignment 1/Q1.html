    <p>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs 
       in terms of length: a <!--i>paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph
       is half a page long, etc.<i--> <br>In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas 
       among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.</p>
